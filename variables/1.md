Beginning Variable Exercises
============================

For each of the situation given, make up 3 or more variables that you
think might relevant, and assign them some example values.  Then use
a command in your scripting language to output a sentence containing
some of the variable values.

For now, don't worry if the variables and values you choose are exactly right
for actually implementing an app.  Just go with your gut, and explore
what pieces of data fit the problem.


Example
-------

**Situation** You're implementing a Calendar App.

**Possible Answer in PHP**

    $event1 = "Mom's Birthday";
    $event1date = "November 4";

    $event2 = "Christmas";
    $event2date = "December 25";

    # sentence
    echo "$event1 is coming up soon on $event1date. I'm looking forward to $event2!";

**Possible Answer in Javascript**
(Javascript gurus please feel free to correct my scoping etc.)

    var event1 = "Mom's Birthday";
    var event1date = "November 4";

    var event2 = "Christmas";
    var event2date = "December 25";

    // sentence
    console.log(event1 + " is coming up soon on " + event1date + ". I'm looking forward to " + event2 + "!");
